### About: 
Sentiment analysis conducted on tweets written by customers from 6 major U.S. airlines 

### Sentiment Analysis Context
The term "Sentiment Analysis" was coined by Nasukawa et al. in 2003.

### General Objective: 
To conduct a Sentiment Analysis on the tweets written about major U.S. Airlines by implementing the techniques learned as a part of the subject "Natural Language Processing".

### Specific Objectives: 
- SO1) Demonstrate basic understanding of text pre-processing, 
- SO2) Provide practical application of the process after pre-processing, 
- SO3) Apply Bag of Words, 
- SO4) Apply Tf-idf, 
- SO5) Build classification models, 
- SO6) Evaluate models, 
- SO7) Summarize the understanding of application of the various techniques on the dataset.

### Key Questions: 
- KQ1) Can we predict whether a tweet contains positive, negative or neutral sentiment about a particular airline?, 
- KQ2) Can analysis/classification of tweets help Airlines to detect negative social mentions that could harm their business?, 
- KQ3) Which pre-processing techniques are more suitable cleaning procedures to to reduce noise text and to make sure they are suitable for machine learning modeling?

### Learning Outcomes: 
- LO1) Basic understanding of text pre-processing, 
- LO2) What to do after text pre-processing, 
- LO3) Bag of words, 
- LO4) Tf-idf, 
- LO5) Build the classification model, 
- LO6) Evaluate the Model
